/**
 * Game data and logic class. Games are simple finite state machines, with 3 states that wait for
 * user input, and 3 transient states that it quickly passes through on the way back to a waiting
 * state:
 *
 * ......Lobby.----------->.Dealing.(transient).-------->.Playing
 * .......^........................^.........................|....................
 * .......|.v----.Win.(transient).<+------.Judging.<---------+....................
 * .....Reset.(transient)
 *
 * Lobby is the default state. When the game host sends a start game event, the game moves to the
 * Dealing state, where it deals out cards to every player and automatically moves into the Playing
 * state. After all players have played a card, the game moves to Judging and waits for the judge to
 * pick a card. The game either moves to Win, if a player reached the win goal, or Dealing
 * otherwise. Win moves through Reset to reset the game back to default state. The game also
 * immediately moves through Reset at any point there are fewer than 3 players in the game.
