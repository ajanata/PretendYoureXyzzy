<h3>A Cards Against Humanity clone.</h3>
<p>
  This webapp is still in development. There will be bugs, but hopefully they won't affect gameplay
  very much.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Your computer's IP address will <strong>always</strong> be logged when you load the game client.
  It is not tied in any way to your username, except possibly if a server error occurs. Gameplay
  results are logged permanently, but without information identifying you.
</p>
<p>Recent Changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 September 2018:<ul>
    <li>All chat and fill-in-the-blank cards have been disabled. If you're still out of the loop,
    <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ajanata/07ededdb584f7bb77a8c7191d3a4bbcc/raw/e76faacc19c2bb598a1a8fd94b9ebcb29c5502e0">
    here's why.</a></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="changelog.html">Older entries.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do not open the game more than once in the same browser.</strong> Neither instance
  will receive all data from the server, and you will not be able to play. I have an idea on how to
  fix this, but I haven't had time to do so.</li>
  <li>This game was extensively tested in <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.
  It should work in all recent versions of major browsers, but it may not look 100% as intended. If
  you find a major issue, please
  <a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/issues/new">open a bug on GitHub</a> with a
  screenshot and the name and version of the browser you are using, and I'll try to fix it.
  </li>
  <li>You may not always see your card in the top area after you play it, but it has been played.
  Also, sometimes the card will display in the top area but be small. I have no idea why either of
  these happen.</li>
  <li>If you refresh in the game, an error will pop up in the log briefly before the refresh
  happens. It is safe to ignore.</li>
  <li>You may see an error after joining a game. As the error message states, this is safe to
  ignore. I will figure out a way to make this not show up.</li>
  <li>Interface elements may not be perfectly sized and positioned immediately after loading the
  page if your window is sufficiently small. Resize the window to fix.</li>
  <li>A player joining the game in progress may have a slightly incorrect representation of the
  game state until the next round begins.</li>
  <li>Reloading the page when the winning card is displayed does not display the winning card
  again.</li>
  <li>Played cards seem to blank when someone joins or leaves. You may have to refresh the page
  to see the cards again if you're the Card Czar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Current limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Black Cards with "pick" and/or "draw" annotations is rudimentary. When you play
  your cards, it does not group them until the judging starts. Also, when other players play cards,
  you do not see any progress from them until they have played all 2 or 3 cards, and it only shows
  a single face-down card for them. I will try to make this look nicer, but it works.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Also, you cannot un-do your first (or second) card: Once it's played, it's played.</li>
	    <li>While judging, only one card will be highlighted. It does not matter which card in a group
	    you click, the game will figure it out.</li>
	    <li>I know that when you have a lot of players, especially with Pick 2 or Pick 3, it gets very
      hard to read, and cards overlap (and underlap) your hand, and are hard to click sometimes.
      I'll work on this soon. You can resize the window to try to help if you're having problems
      for now.</li>
	  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can't bet Awesome Points to play another card, and I am unsure if I will add this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There may be an option to display who played every card.</li>
  <li>A registration system and long-term statistics tracking may be added at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the game seems to be in a weird state, refresh the page and it should take you back to where
  you were. It would be helpful to take a screenshot and include it in a
  <a href="https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy/issues/new">new bug on GitHub</a> along with
  a general description of the problem and the time that it happened (include a time zone please!).
